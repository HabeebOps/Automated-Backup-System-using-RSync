# Automated-Backup-System-using-RSync
### Project Overview:
In this project, we'll create an automated backup system using rsync to synchronize files and directories between two Ubuntu servers. One server will act as the source server, containing the files to be backed up, and the other server will serve as the destination server, where the backups will be stored. We'll schedule regular backups using cron jobs and configure email notifications for backup completion or failure.
